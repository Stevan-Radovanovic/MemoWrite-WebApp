Let/Const
1. let has a block scope, not available outside of the curly braces
2. const variables can't be changed, unless they are reference types (arrays, objects)
3. hoisting does not work with let/const variables

Arrow functions
1. if the func has only one line of code, and it's a return, the return word can be omitted
2. this doesn't changes it's context depending on from where it is called

Default Parameters
1. Default values for parameters are available, with the = sign

Object literals
1. You are allowed to not provide the values for properties, if they are defined before the object
2. dynamic name adding is available with []
    let field = "fieldName"
    let obj  = {
        [field]: 25
    }

Operators
1. Rest operator (...parameter) - puts all the parameters into an array
2. Spread operator (...array) = spreads the elements from an array into individual variables

For-of loop
1. Works like the foreach loop

Template literals
1. Example `${var1} is very ${var2}`
